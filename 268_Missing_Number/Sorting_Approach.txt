Sorting Approach:the main idea here is to sort the vector so the perdicted vector will be a sorted vector containig all values from 0 to n - 1(size of the vector).example:vector = [3,0,2] the missing element is 1after sorting -> vector = [0,2,3]initialize a variable with value 0.loop to all elements of the vector and check if it is equal to the value of the iterator.loop 1:iterator = 0 & vector[0] = 0 -> equal loop 2:iterator = 1 & vector[1] = 2 -> not equal -> then return the iterator
