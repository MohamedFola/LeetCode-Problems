Summing Approach:the main idea here is to sum all elements from 0 to n - 1, where n is the size of vector, and sum all elements in the vector.then the difference between the two numbers will be the missing element.example:vector = [3,0,2] the missing element is 1sum all element from 1 to 3 -> sum = 6NOTE: the equation used to sum is ( n * ( n + 1 ) ) / 2sum all elements in the vector -> 3 + 0 + 2 = 5return the difference between the two numbers -> 6 - 5 = 1
