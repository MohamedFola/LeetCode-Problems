Map approach:

create a map with int keys and int values
map<int, int>m;

key -> elements of the vector
value -> number of repetitions of this key

loop throught the vector and add to the map the key and increment the value.
once you finish looping throught all elements of the vector, loop throught elements of the map and check the value.

if m.second is less than 2 then this is the desired value.

example:
1) looping throught vector elements
vector = [4,4,5]

first loop:
map = {4,1}

second loop:
map = {4,2}

third loop:
map = {4,2}, {5,1}

2) looping throught map elements
first loop:
value of key 4 is 2, is  2 < 2 ?? -> no

second loop:
value of key 5 is 1, is 1 < 2 -> yes then return 5
