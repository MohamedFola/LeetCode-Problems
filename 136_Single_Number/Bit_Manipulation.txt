Bit Manipulation:

the main idea here is that xoring anything by itself will give 0 and xoring anything with 0 will give the same number
for example: 
a ^ a = 0
a ^ 0 = a

so it is expected for xoring any element that is duplicated to give 0 and xoring 0 with the element that has no duplication will give the same element,
and returnig this element will be the desired answer.

example:
vector = [4,4,5]
result = 0

first loop:
result ^= 4 -> result = 0 ^ 4 = 4

second loop:
result ^= 4 -> result = 4 ^ 4 = 0

third loop:
result ^= 5 -> result = 0 ^ 5 = 5

then return the result.
